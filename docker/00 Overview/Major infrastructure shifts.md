With Docker, we have an incluse solution, both for developers and sys operators. 

Containers are the "Fastest growing cloud enabling technology" that is changing the world. 

### The challenge

in the picture below, maintaining multiple technology stacks across multiple environments was a nightmare earlier. On top of this, one has to also worry about migrating to a different technology, upgrades, etc., which not only makes it more complex, but completely nonviable to support without having huge impact of CTO and operations.

### The matrix from hell

If you Google "Matrix from Hell," I am sure you will find lot of articles on how Docker solves the matrix from hell quandary.

So what precisely is the matrix from hell? In simple words, it is the challenge of packaging any application, irrespective of language/frameworks/dependencies, so that it can run on any cloud, irrespective of the underlying OS/hardware/infrastructure.

### Solution: Intermodal Shipping Container

The introduction of Docker helped in the eliminating of this matrix, by isolating the worries of developers and administrators. Developers can focus on bundling applications and dependencies as containers, without agonizing over underlying hardware/infrastructure. Administrators/DevOps team can concentrate on managing containers, without agonizing over the contents of those containers.

### Solution: Benefits for Developers & Administrators

### What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping & running distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs or cloud. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The Docker Platform consists of multiple product/tools, including the Docker Engine, Images, Containers, and Hub, among others.

The Docker platform is the only container platform to build, secure and manage the widest array of applications from development to production both on premises and in the cloud.



### Why Docker?
Docker is all about speed.
- Develop  faster
- Build faster
- Test faster
- deploy faster
- update / upgrade faster
- recover faster
- maintenance faster 

It covers all the lifecycle.
